# Virtual Museum
Virtual Museum created in Unity. Co-author: Ryszard SzczÄ™ch. 2016.

Project was supposed to be a part of "Wirtualne Muzeum" (Virtual Museum), Lublin University of Technology's project. 
Sadly, we don't know if it made it there after we handed over the source code... buuut we have reasonable suspicion that YES (It was on TV and one of the participants was using VR headset) :D

### Project is a two-parter:
1. Unity application on Android
2. Website with relics to download
We didn't manage to make a link between them due to limited time. Buy yeah, there it is.

### Application features:
- showcase of a relic model
- visible description of a relic
- text-to-speech for description (tho it doesn't really work in polish, as you can see below)
- works with gamepad and/or VR headset with a button

Website is ugly. I don't even know if I should post it here.
